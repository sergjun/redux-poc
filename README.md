# Redux POC

Just a proof of concept to help me understand better redux and how to use it.

Hope this will help me to fixated the concepts of reducers and actions and how they work together.

## Some quick noted that I did while studying:

- Redux is a tool to help you manage states in your application.

## STORE

Globalized state

## Action

Some action, like the description to do something
A function that returns a object

## Reducer

A function that takes the previous state and an action, and returns the next state

## Dispatcher

The method that calls the reducer which takes a action and change the state in the store

# Running

- yarn install (or npm install)
- yarn start
